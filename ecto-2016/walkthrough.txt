Here is a walkthrough for the re-release of A Checkered Haunting.

First four ways through are these or a mirror image/rotation. Regardless of where you start, you can follow the conveyor belt.

Last one is not solvable because of a mathematical trick. If you label the map like a checkerboard there are 13 "black" squares and 11 "red" but you alternate between black and red.

But what happens is, there's a checkerboard to examine. It goes from 8x8 to 6x6 to 4x4 to 5x5. Also, some dominoes appear. They and the checkerboard push you away, so you can't take them on your own.

Then you'll note that there's also a magnet, and you're pulled to it at the start. The magnet can pick up the checkerboard and dominoes. If you get the magnet first, and you get the checkerboard and dominoes later, you can then X the checkerboard until you want to SOLVE it. You're strictly on your honor for this, but the more you examine, the more hints/perspective you get. Eventually examining it just leads to solving it, anyway.

So the solution is to keep examining the checkerboard when you find it in Programmerville (always the last) and then get the magnet once it appears. Then you should be able to stumble across the board and dominoes. While there may be a configuration that gives makes getting the magnet first then getting the other two items impossible, or you may run across a non-magnet first by accident, the game does check for configurations that don't work, and you can always restart. In addition, if we consider the 5x5 map a checkerboard of its own and the corner squares are black and the other squares are white, all the items are on white squares. So if you get a route that takes out everything but the two black squares, you will hit all three items.

So eventually, you should get everything in the right order.

You may notice it's quicker to run into a dead end right away to get to the next checkerboard, and there's no penalty for doing so. This may save a few moves.
