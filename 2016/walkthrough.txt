Here is a walkthrough for A Checkered Haunting.

First four ways through are these or a mirror image/rotation:

X>>>v
>^v<v
^<<^v
>>>^v
^<<<<

>vX>v
^v>^v
^v^<v
^>>^v
^<<<<

>>>>v
^Xv<<
^<>>v
>^v<v
^<<^<

>>>>v
^v<<<
^vX>v
^>>^v
^<<<<

Last one is not solvable because of a mathematical trick. If you label the map like a checkerboard there are 13 "black" squares and 11 "red" but you alternate between black and red.

To solve you sort of need to guess the verb.

"parity" and "color" and "colors"or "corners" and "corner" and "count" and "prove" and "disprove"
