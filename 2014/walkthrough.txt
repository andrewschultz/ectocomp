Walkthrough for Candy Rush Saga by Andrew Schultz

Someone's done this puzzle, probably, somehow, somewhere, but I like the idea of sort-of rescuing bullied kids from meaner bigger kids.

Incidentally, there's no strategic difference between bullies or chased kids.

The map is labeled as follows. It's probably easier to look at this conceptually than provide move-by-move blows. You can MAP to see where everyone is. You start at 5, bullies are randomized from 1-4, and chased kids are randomized from 6-9. This is really just a peg-shifting puzzle. You can see the solution in the source, too. It takes 20 moves if you use BF.

Congratulations! I'm pretty sure the quickest way through is 20 moves. You need to move one kid or bully the wrong direction near the beginning, which adds two moves, and you need to do so near the end, because symmetry. Plus you need a very minimum of 16 moves since the kids go from a net of 1E3S of the center to 1W3N (8 moves) and the bullies flip that (another 8.) Please forgive the lack of mathematical rigor for this SpeedIF. I'm already down to my last minu
