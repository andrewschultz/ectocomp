This is a listing of all my short Text Adventure/Interactive Fiction games

They are mostly for EctoComp, which was conceived and hosted by [JJ Guest](http://www.jjguest.com), but anything with a small scope will go in here.

This is a listing of all my EctoComp games.

The numbered links go to IFDB (the Interactive Fiction Database) while the wordy ones go to the folders in the repository, so you can see what the game names are, and stuff.

* EctoComp games
  * 2011 [IFDB Entry](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewcomp?id=b98q8oo6x14j0yx) and [Dash Slapney and the Calamitous Candy Corn Cornucopia, local project](ecto-2011)
  * 2012, I didn't enter, but I judged.
  * 2013 [IFDB Entry](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewcomp?id=khvv2nr6z6lyopvz) and [The Argument-Winner's Ghost, local project](ecto-2013)
  * 2014 [IFDB Entry](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewcomp?id=e5dj3yvlrykixs1e) and [Candy Rush Saga, local project](ecto-2014)
  * 2015 [IFDB Entry](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewcomp?id=4efcfdg9wbx2cjk0) and [Heezy Park, local project](ecto-2015)
  * 2016 [IFDB Entry](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewcomp?id=8enhcyktio2iywzm) and [A Checkered Haunting, local project](ecto-2016)
* Non-EctoComp games
   * Mrs. Crabtree's Geography Class, which isn't an EctoComp game but is sort of speed-if. [IFDB link](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=k1y9t9tm02vl1s) / [Playfic.com link](http://playfic.com/games/AndrewS/mrs-crabtrees-geography-class) is an older version that had to fit in the Z5 format, so it does not have all the bells and whistles.

My hope is to have my [Itch.io page](https://andrewschultz.itch.io/) contain all of these games eventually, once they are (re-)tested.
