Mrs Crabtree's Geography Class has online play [Playfic.com link](http://playfic.com/games/AndrewS/mrs-crabtrees-geography-class), and it has an [IFDB link](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=k1y9t9tm02vl1s).

This version will be kept more up-to-date. When I wrote Crabtree back in 2012, Playfic.com had stringent rules on game memory, and some of the user-friendliness features were omitted.

Also, the UUIDs for my two games are different. EBB481B7-B422-4B7B-9419-DCCBE6DFC308
