# The Argument Winner's Ghost sub-repository

11th out of 25 in EctoComp 2013

This game is undergoing a bunch of bug fixes right now. I left a lot broken in the original version, with missed implementations, etc. The object is to close these loopholes.

There are nine different endings based on how involved your arguments with Harley are. You can win any argument nicely or meanly, or you can just ignore him. No one ending is philosophically better than the next.
